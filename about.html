<p>
  I am a <span class="highlight">Postdoctoral Researcher</span> at the 
  <span class="highlight">Extreme Computing Research Center</span> at 
  <span class="highlight">KAUST</span>, working under the supervision of 
  <span class="highlight">Professor David Keyes</span>.
</p>
<p>
  My work is conducted in close collaboration with <span class="highlight">Dr. Hatem Ltaief</span>, focusing on 
  <span class="highlight">high-performance computing (HPC)</span> techniques for advancing Bayesian inference methodologies. 
  I hold a <span class="highlight">Ph.D. in Statistics</span>, completed under the supervision of 
  <span class="highlight">Professor HÃ¥vard Rue</span>.
</p>
<p>
  My research lies at the intersection of <span class="highlight">computational statistics</span> and 
  <span class="highlight">scalable numerical algorithms</span>, with an emphasis on developing 
  HPC frameworks that enable efficient and robust statistical modeling.
