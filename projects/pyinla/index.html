    <p>
      <strong>pyINLA</strong> is a Python interface for the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) method, built to bring the power of Bayesian inference into modern Python-based workflows. It bridges INLA’s efficiency with Python’s versatility — enabling scalable, reproducible modeling in a wide range of applications.

    <h2>Highlights</h2>

    <h3>📘 Handbook Coming Fall 2025</h3>
    <p>
      A full handbook with examples, applications, and best practices is in development and will be released in <strong>Fall 2025</strong>. It will help both new users and advanced practitioners take full advantage of pyINLA.
    </p>

    <h3>🤝 Looking for Collaborations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Researchers with potential applications in spatial modeling, time-series, epidemiology, and more</li>
      <li>Developers interested in extending or testing the Python interface</li>
      <li>Feedback and benchmarking across domains and computing environments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💡 Applications</h3>
    <p>
      We're especially interested in real-world uses in fields such as environmental science, geostatistics, health data, and any domain requiring fast Bayesian inference on large models.
