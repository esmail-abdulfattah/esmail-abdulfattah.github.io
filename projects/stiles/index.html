    <h3>üé§ Presentations on sTiles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>From Single Core to Many Cores to GPUs</strong><br>
        INLA Workshop, University of Glasgow, Scotland (2025)<br>
        <a href="./pdfs/sTiles_presentation1.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides PDF]</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>sTiles: An Accelerated Computational Framework for Sparse Factorizations of Structured Matrices</strong><br>
        ISC High Performance 2025, Hamburg, Germany<br>
        <a href="./pdfs/sTiles_presentation2.pdf" target="_blank">[View Slides PDF]</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While there is some overlap between the two slide decks, the presentation at the INLA Workshop is tailored for statisticians, whereas the ISC talk targets an HPC audience. For a complete understanding, we recommend consulting the published papers above.

    <h3>üì¨ Stay Connected</h3>
    <p>
      If you're interested in joining the <strong>sTiles email list</strong> to receive updates about the project, or if you'd like to <strong>contribute to the development of a Python wrapper</strong>, please feel free to contact me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also happy to receive <strong>test matrices</strong> that perform poorly with the current solver, we can explore customizations to improve performance and robustness.
