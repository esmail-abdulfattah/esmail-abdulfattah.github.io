      Volunteering at the Children Cancer Center of Lebanon was one of the most rewarding experiences in my life. A year before, I had heard about the opportunity and immediately took it â€” attending the orientation workshop and beginning my journey with CCCL.

    <p>
      My role was to directly impact the lives of children fighting tragic illnesses by creating a family atmosphere filled with love, hope, faith, and fun. From playing UNO and Babyfoot to coloring, singing, and building puzzles, every activity helped bring joy and lightness into their lives. Some days, we played GTA on the computer or shared funny stories. These children became like new siblings â€” their laughter and courage etched deeply into my memory.

    <p>
      One child couldnâ€™t speak â€” I was speechless in front of her. So I told her stories using only my hands and facial expressions. Alongside other volunteers, we tried to fill every corner â€” from the playroom to the hospital rooms â€” with joy, noise, and life.
    </p>

      Even on my busiest days, I wanted to be there. I felt they were waiting. Those two hours made my day feel purposeful. I taught them letters and shapes, played logic games, and encouraged them to stay away from screens and engage socially. The parents were incredibly welcoming and grateful. Though often painful to talk with, they remained hopeful and cooperative, despite the grueling chemotherapy cycles every two weeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experience changed me. I realized how small my own problems were in comparison. These young heroes, despite everything, taught me about resilience, hope, and faith. I learned the importance of human connection, communication, and compassion. I became more responsible, more knowledgeable about cancer, and more appreciative of the little things.

      If you ever want to do something meaningful with your free time â€” go volunteer. A word of encouragement or a listening ear can make more difference than you think. Often, the things you receive dwarf anything you give.
