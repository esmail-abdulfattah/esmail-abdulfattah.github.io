    <p><em>What’s the point of simplicity when you can complicate your research method and call it "thorough"? 🤔</em></p>

    <p><strong>Ibrahim vs. Fahd:</strong></p>

    <p>🏃‍♂️ Ibrahim ran 10 km in one hour, while Fahd took 1.5 hours. Based on time alone, Ibrahim looks like the clear winner.</p>

    <p>But wait… what if I told you Ibrahim ran on a prepared track, while Fahd ran on rough terrain? Suddenly, Fahd’s effort seems a bit more impressive, doesn’t it? 🌍</p>

    <p>Now let’s add another detail: Ibrahim weighs 90 kg, while Fahd weighs just 55 kg. Now, Ibrahim’s performance starts to stand out. 💪</p>

    <p>Oh, and one more thing—Ibrahim is 23 years old, and Fahd is 74. Now Fahd’s run feels almost extraordinary! 🎉</p>

    <p>Each new detail shifts the basis for comparison. With every additional piece of information, the context changes, and so does the judgment of who’s better. 📊</p>

    <p>The same thing happens when an HR manager compares job candidates—or when academics like us evaluate different research methods. 🧠</p>

    <p>Each new factor significantly changes the perceived value and effectiveness of a method, making objective assessment challenging. That’s why a comprehensive evaluation that considers all relevant factors is crucial for a fair comparison. ✅</p>
