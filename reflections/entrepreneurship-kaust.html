    <p>
      Another remarkable experience! If you're thirsty for knowledge, enthusiastic to learn new skills, eager to unleash your inner power, and want to build both your professional network and communication skills â€” then entrepreneurship might be exactly what you're looking for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this experience, I learned that <strong>entrepreneurship is not just about business</strong>, but about transforming challenges into opportunities, building resilience, and applying <strong>design thinking</strong> to innovate and solve problems creatively.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had the privilege of being part of the <strong>Entrepreneurship for All Program â€“ Special Edition â€“ Summer 2021</strong> at KAUST. This program was held in partnership with <strong>UC Berkeley</strong>, <strong>Stanford</strong>, and <strong>Cornell University</strong> â€” three of the worldâ€™s leading innovation hubs.
    </p>

    <p>
      A huge thank you to the <strong>KAUST Innovation Team</strong> and the three exceptional partner teams for an unforgettable summer of growth, insight, and inspiration!
