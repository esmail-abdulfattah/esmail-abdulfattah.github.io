    <h1>üìò PADILEIA Project!</h1>

    <p>My experience at <strong>PADILEIA</strong> has had an impact on my career, as it was the first station in the field of education. The project has been implemented by <strong>AUB</strong> and funded by <strong>King's College London</strong> in collaboration with <strong>Kayani organization</strong>.</p>

    <p>This picture was the end of a busy, fruitful year with students full of hope, energy, and enthusiasm. I am confident enough that they are having plans that meet their aspirations.</p>

    <p>Then I continued as a <strong>coordinator of the Math subject</strong> in the program, which lasted until this year, and resulted in the <em>booklet</em> (attached) ‚Äî starting with the first version in 2018 and continuing through multiple versions with ongoing development.</p>

    <p>And this, for me, will always keep teaching as a career of <strong>passion, challenge, and persistence</strong>!</p>
