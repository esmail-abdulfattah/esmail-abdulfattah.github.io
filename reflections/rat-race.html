    <ul>
      <li>A Ph.D. student who published one paper is unhappy because another Ph.D. student published five.</li>
      <li>The Ph.D. student with five papers is unhappy because they have fewer citations than a colleague.</li>
      <li>A Ph.D. student with an appreciative advisor is unhappy because their research funding is limited.</li>
      <li>The student with less publication pressure is unhappy because they lack access to cutting-edge lab equipment.</li>
      <li>The married colleague is unhappy because they earn less than a single colleague.</li>
      <li>The single colleague with the highest salary is unhappy because their nationality doesnâ€™t afford them certain privileges.</li>
      <li>The colleague with the privileged nationality is unhappy because they didn't attend a top-tier university.</li>
      <li>The graduate from the top-tier university is unhappy because they didn't get a job at a prestigious company.</li>
      <li>The student with ample research funding is unhappy because they face immense pressure to publish more.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what happens when you get trapped in the infinite rat race. You are never happy. And you will never appreciate or be grateful for the life you have.</p>

    <p>You will only be satisfied when you do your best with what you have. Until then, the pursuit of more will always leave you wanting more...</p>
