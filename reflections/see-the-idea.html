      It is not only about the quality of your research â€” it's about how well and how long you can grab people's attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      You often have two options:
      <ol>
        <li>Fill your slides with equations that many will struggle to follow,</li>
        <li>Or invest a bit more time to convey the ideas in a creative and intuitive way.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Personally, I avoid attending most seminars for two reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>The presenter doesn't know how to explain the concepts clearly.</li>
        <li>The topic doesn't interest me â€” but I have to attend out of duty, program requirements, or requests from my supervisor.</li>
      </ol>
      But hereâ€™s the thing: if the **first problem** is solved, the **second one** becomes irrelevant. Because good ideas, well communicated, can captivate anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      I deeply appreciate every researcher and the effort they invest in their work. So hereâ€™s a kind reminder:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      It took you months â€” maybe years â€” to reach what you're presenting. Please donâ€™t expect your audience to follow all the equations and notation in one hour. What we really need is the **idea**, the **insight**, and your **creativity in explaining it**.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      I'm a visual learner. I respect other types of learners, but when concepts are visualized well, they transcend learning styles. Here's an example:
    </p>

    <img src="../images/hard.png" alt="Mathematical Representation" class="reflection-image" />

    <p>
      These two show the same thing â€” an interaction between space and time. One reaches more minds.
