    <p>
      Whenever I would walk into his office, burdened with feelings of depression and mental exhaustion, I would always leave with renewed energy and confidence. His endless patience and unwavering belief in my abilities have been truly remarkable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my years as a Ph.D. student, I had the incredible fortune of being under the guidance of a supervisor who possessed extensive expertise as a Bayesian expert. Professor HÃ¥vard, I cannot express enough how grateful I am to you for the invaluable support you provided and the impact you had on my academic journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      I promise to continue striving for excellence and making you proud of my accomplishments.
