      Teaching experience is always a cherished experience. You go as a teacher but you come back as a student â€” with valuable insights and fresh perspectives on learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      My recent teaching journey at <strong>KAUST Academy</strong> â€” a dedicated program designed to prepare students for a Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence â€” was a testament to this. From January to March 2023, I had the privilege of supporting the students through their academic transition, contributing to their growth while rediscovering my own learning style.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning is, in itself, an incredibly enjoyable process and an endless opportunity for improvement. This experience reminded me that teaching is not just about sharing knowledge, but also about shaping confidence, mentoring mindsets, and continuously growing alongside others.
    </p>

    <p>
      A heartfelt thank you to <strong>Dr. Sultan Barakati</strong>, <strong>Dr. David Pugh</strong>, and <strong>Angela Baranski</strong> for the opportunity and support throughout this meaningful experience!
