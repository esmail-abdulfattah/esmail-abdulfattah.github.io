    <h1>Teaching is Really Fun!</h1>

    <p><strong>Teaching assistant</strong> is assisting this fun!</p>

    <p>I have been doing this type of assistant for four years now. I believe that you can't <strong>MASTER</strong> the knowledge you have without being able to explain it. AND when you learn it and keep practicing it, no one can take it from you!</p>

    <p>To be honest I used to be that diligent student who always wants that "A"! This is how many <strong>educational_systems</strong> are set to be or want us to be. However, the teacher plays a big role in changing this. I like curious students who keep asking to learn and to understand! SO BE <strong>CURIOUS</strong>! AND LET OTHERS BE CURIOUS OF HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE!</p>

    <p>It is a very enlightening experience when you decide to assist in a different course each semester! It expands your <strong>knowledge</strong>, empowers your mind, and prepares you well for any future <strong>challenging</strong> research. AND you understand the teacher's <strong>perspective</strong>, styles, and some <strong>teaching</strong> tricks 😉.</p>

    <p>Here are the courses I was part of as assistant so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bayesian Statistics</li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>Numerical Linear Algebra</li>
      <li>Linear_Models</li>
      <li>Numerical Computing</li>
      <li>Discrete Models for Differential Equations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's <strong>wonderful</strong>! Isn't it? 😉<br>
    You can assist YES!!! but you should have some <strong>impact</strong> and positive <strong>influence</strong> on how the course is taught.</p>
