    <h1>Visa People vs. Non-Visa People</h1>

    <img src="../images/visa-reflection.jpeg" alt="Visa paperwork" class="reflection-banner" />

    <p>
      There are two types of people: <strong>Visa People</strong> and <strong>Non-Visa People</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      ‚úà <strong>Non-Visa People</strong><br>
      They breeze through borders, flash their passports, and get a cheerful "Welcome!" from immigration. Life is good.
    </p>

    <p>
      üõÇ <strong>Visa People</strong><br>
      For them, travel is a mission. A high-stakes paperwork heist. A test of patience, finances, and willpower. To even consider stepping into a Non-Visa land, they must gather:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bank Statements:</strong> A six-month saga detailing every coffee, snack, and impulse buy.</li>
      <li><strong>Passport Stamps:</strong> A scrapbook of every border crossed, complete with dates and officer signatures.</li>
      <li><strong>Photo Collection:</strong> A visual timeline from baby‚Äôs first steps to last week‚Äôs selfie.</li>
      <li><strong>Sponsorship Proof:</strong> A sworn affidavit from a benefactor promising to fund your escapade.</li>
      <li><strong>Itinerary:</strong> A minute-by-minute plan, including restroom breaks and snack times.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Guarantee:</strong> A tidy sum set aside to assure authorities you can handle unexpected mishaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Residency Proof:</strong> If you're living abroad, proof that your stay is legit and lasting.</li>
      <li><strong>Bookings:</strong> Confirmed flights and accommodations, because spontaneity is overrated.</li>
      <li><strong>Character Assessment:</strong> Questions like, "Have you ever committed torture or genocide?" Because wrongdoers always confess on forms.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Media Handles:</strong> A list of your online personas ‚Äî vital to national security, obviously.</li>
      <li><strong>Farm Visits:</strong> Whether you've seen a goat in the last six weeks. Critical information.</li>
      <li><strong>Translation Services:</strong> Got documents not in the right language? Translate everything ‚Äî at your expense.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      üìç Your passport embarks on a mysterious journey. It disappears into the embassy abyss for at least 3 weeks, with no email replies and no travel possible in the meantime.
    </p>

    <p>
      üéØ If approved, congratulations! You now have a visa for exactly the number of days in your itinerary ‚Äî no more, no less.
    </p>

    <h2>üíé The Luxury Fast-Track (for a price, of course)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>$600+ for "express" processing (which still isn‚Äôt that fast).</li>
      <li>$130 for a "VIP at-home service" where they collect documents from you instead of making you beg at the visa center.</li>
      <li>Visa Fees ‚Äì Because, obviously.</li>
      <li>Visa Center Fees ‚Äì Because paying for the visa alone isn‚Äôt enough.</li>
      <li>$130 just to keep your passport with you ‚Äî yes, they charge extra if you want to hold your own passport during processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      After all that? You might still get rejected.<br>
      <strong>Welcome to the Visa People struggle.</strong>
